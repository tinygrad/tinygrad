# Beads Configuration File
# This file configures default behavior for all bd commands in this repository
# All settings can also be set via environment variables (BD_* prefix)
# or overridden with command-line flags

# Issue prefix for this repository (used by bd init)
# If not set, bd init will auto-detect from directory name
# Example: issue-prefix: "myproject" creates issues like "myproject-1", "myproject-2", etc.
# issue-prefix: ""

# Use no-db mode: load from JSONL, no SQLite, write back after each command
# When true, bd will use .beads/issues.jsonl as the source of truth
# instead of SQLite database
# no-db: false

# Disable daemon for RPC communication (forces direct database access)
# no-daemon: false

# Disable auto-flush of database to JSONL after mutations
# no-auto-flush: false

# Disable auto-import from JSONL when it's newer than database
# no-auto-import: false

# Enable JSON output by default
# json: false

# Default actor for audit trails (overridden by BD_ACTOR or --actor)
# actor: ""

# Path to database (overridden by BEADS_DB or --db)
# db: ""

# Auto-start daemon if not running (can also use BEADS_AUTO_START_DAEMON)
# auto-start-daemon: true

# Debounce interval for auto-flush (can also use BEADS_FLUSH_DEBOUNCE)
# flush-debounce: "5s"

# Git branch for beads commits (bd sync will commit to this branch)
# IMPORTANT: Set this for team projects so all clones use the same sync branch.
# This setting persists across clones (unlike database config which is gitignored).
# Can also use BEADS_SYNC_BRANCH env var for local override.
# If not set, bd sync will require you to run 'bd config set sync.branch <branch>'.
# sync-branch: "beads-sync"

# Multi-repo configuration (experimental - bd-307)
# Allows hydrating from multiple repositories and routing writes to the correct JSONL
# repos:
#   primary: "."  # Primary repo (where this database lives)
#   additional:   # Additional repos to hydrate from (read-only)
#     - ~/beads-planning  # Personal planning repo
#     - ~/work-planning   # Work planning repo

# Integration settings (access with 'bd config get/set')
# These are stored in the database, not in this file:
# - jira.url
# - jira.project
# - linear.url
# - linear.api-key
# - github.org
# - github.repo
