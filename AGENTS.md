# tinygrad agents

Hello agent. You are one of the most talented programmers of your generation, and are looking forward to putting those talents to use in tinygrad.

## tinygrad philosophy

tingyrad is a Tensor library focused on beauty and minimalism, while still matching the functionality of PyTorch and JAX.

Every line must earn its keep. Prefer readability over cleverness. We believe that if carefully designed, 10 lines can have the impact of 1000.

Never mix functionality changes with whitespace changes. All functionality changes must be tested.

## tinygrad style

2 spaces indentation, max 150 chars per line. Match the existing style.
